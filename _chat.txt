[10/10/2021, 21:11:55] matt: Hey everyone!

I was thinking of us going ice skating to Guildford spectrum next week (week of 18th october). The plan would be to meet at west byfleet or woking station and catch a train to guildford. After that we can catch a bus to the spectrum and go ice skating from there.

If you could let me know if you are around for it.

Thanks,
Matt

[12/10/2021, 17:59:42] Matthew Lees-Smith: I think anything should be fine for me, I can easily go directly to guilford or if people want to go on the train together as part of the experience then i’m fine with that too
[12/10/2021, 18:04:11] Matthew Lees-Smith: the total should be £10.08 right?
[12/10/2021, 18:07:44] matt: spectrum is around £10 so yea

[12/10/2021, 18:45:16] matt: just let me know so i know how many tickets to get
[13/10/2021, 17:43:50] matt: hey gang, hope you are all well… here are the details for ice skating next week!

Date: Wednesday 20th October 2021

Plan:
•Meet at Woking Station at 19:30 and once everyone is there aim to catch the 19:43 train to Guildford which arrives at 19:54. (I’ll meet you guys at Guildford station)
•After that we are going to walk to the bus station at the Friary which is about a 5-10 minute walk and from there catch Bus 100 at 20:10.
•From there we will get on the bus and go off at spectrum and will get our tickets and etc and go from there!
•Once ice skating has finished you can choose your own way of getting back home. I’m planning on catching bus (either bus 715 at 22:19 or bus 2 at 22:36) back depending on times but anyone can come along as well!

Hope that all sorta makes some sense.

If you plan on going straight to the spectrum please can you drop a message here or message me!

Thanks,
Matt

[22/03/2022, 23:35:20] Amy: Hey guys was thinking of doing a bbq/drinks thing in the Easter hols. Which day works best for people in the 15-18th April? Let me know if you would be up for it and then we can work out dates times plans etc.
[23/03/2022, 12:42:16] matt: 16th april probably works best for me :)
[23/03/2022, 15:46:25] Ben (Amy): I can do any of those dates, sounds like a good idea 👍
[23/03/2022, 15:47:19] Natalie Nowell: Ideal for me would be 18th as I think I’m singing at church on Easter Sunday so that pretty much wipes out 15th and 16th 😂
[23/03/2022, 15:48:02] Amy: Just thinking 18th might be best cause then doesn’t take up weekend but let’s wait for a few more people?
[23/03/2022, 15:48:29] Amy: Also lol need to run the date past my mum when we decide on one
[23/03/2022, 16:25:52] Luke Knowles: i’m away that whole week sorry x
[23/03/2022, 16:29:41] Amy: Just making sure everyone has seen tonight is cancelled
[23/03/2022, 17:00:01] Natalie Nowell: Oh how come?
[23/03/2022, 17:00:20] Amy: Think Anthony has covid
[23/03/2022, 17:00:30] Amy: Xanna told Ben that anyway
[23/03/2022, 17:00:34] Holly Fowler: Oh no
[23/03/2022, 17:01:44] Natalie Nowell: :(
[26/03/2022, 13:25:25] Amy: Hey guys so I am think Easter Monday the 18th probably afternoon/evening what do people think?
[26/03/2022, 14:11:34] Natalie Nowell: Sounds good to me :)
[26/03/2022, 15:50:05] Ben (Amy): Sounds good to me too 👍

[14/04/2022, 07:58:40] Holly Fowler: If you’re wanting ideas Amy, I think burgers always go down well, and maybe hot dogs? As for drinks, would it be okay if I brought a jug of Pimms or are we going completely alcohol free?
[14/04/2022, 08:45:51] Amy: A jug of pimms would be fine as long as everyone coming is happy with some of us drinking?

[25/08/2022, 00:11:17] Jeni COGS: Folks you know how Nat Ben and Freya are going off on their adventures.... and you know how the planet is dying..... well, was wondering if you three (and anyone else) would be interested in stocking up on not murderous stuff for living (e.g. dishwasher tablets, multi surface cleaner, moisturiser, razor, etc.)?? If anyone is, there is a shop in Woking that sells the good stuff so I can get people discount vouchers or like a pile of stuff and then we can dish it out amongst ourselves for who need it this term...... anyone interested??
[25/08/2022, 07:00:36] Amy: Is the shop bare and fair?
[25/08/2022, 07:38:28] Natalie Nowell: That sounds like a good idea :)

[31/08/2022, 21:57:56] Amy: Also, I was thinking we could do a cocktail/mock tail night? So basic plan would be that everyone comes up with one drink. A mocktail or cocktail (but all alcoholic ones need a non alcoholic version) and then everyone has each drink. If you would be up for that then send me a list of the ingredients you need either on here or privately so I can see if I have got them or if you need to change/get the ingredients. Let me know what you think also we can come up with a theme for the drinks like your favourite or your degree or job or we can just do one each :)
[31/08/2022, 22:48:46] Jeni COGS: You are so creative!

[01/10/2022, 10:24:55] Jeni COGS: The event is being held at White Lodge and is hosted by UK Firewalk, one of the UK’s leading firewalking companies. They are hugely experienced and their goal is to ensure the event is fun, challenging and above all safe.

Our brave walkers will receive some motivational pre-walk training before taking on the red hot challenge. It makes for a great spectacle, bring along your spectator friends - we'll have a BBQ and bar to keep everyone refreshed, as well as some red hot tunes set the tone for the evening.

It’s a perfect event for local companies and clubs to enter teams and well as families and other individuals to dare to themselves and raise some essential funds to help White Lodge to continue changing lives!

Each walker will receive a medal, a certificate and a complimentary hot dog and a drink from the BBQ!

Here’s the timetable:

18.00 Registration, Firewalk participants arrive
18.00 The BBQ and bar is opened for spectators!
18.30 Training begins
19:30 Time to Firewalk
20.30 Debrief, food, drinks and celebration!
Restriction: only adults aged 18+ may Firewalk, junior spectators are welcome.

Registration:

£25 per person
Includes a free burger/hotdog from our BBQ 
Please purchase a FREE spectator ticket for each of those coming along to support you, to help us control numbers.
Sponsorship:

We ask that you pledge to raise or donate a minimum of £100 each but there no limit to what you could achieve!
Your fundraising platform will be automatically generated when you purchase your ticket.
£100 could fund two sessions in our hydrotherapy pool for a disabled adult or could provide a child aged 4-12 with 1-2-1 support from a playworker for 2 day sessions.

If this challenge gets you fired up, please sign up today!

[22/11/2022, 08:38:09] Jeni COGS: Yeah!
[24/11/2022, 18:27:08] Natalie Nowell: For the secret santa, if we decide to do it, there’s a website called elfster.com where you can put everyone in a group and randomly allocate names so that even the organiser can be part of it, and make wish lists your person can see - I’ll send the link :)
[24/11/2022, 19:03:15] matt: thank you!! i’ll def use that
[24/11/2022, 19:03:20] matt: ALSO
[24/11/2022, 19:03:35] matt: if anyone does NOT want to do secret santa just pop me a message

[24/11/2022, 19:04:02] Amy: Shouldn’t we work out who can make the day where we can swap first?
[24/11/2022, 19:04:05] Matthew Lees-Smith: or will one person know everyones
[24/11/2022, 19:04:11] Amy: Or do we enter everyone and then they work around it
[24/11/2022, 19:04:21] Amy: I think Nat says it means no one person knows
[24/11/2022, 19:04:33] matt: we’ll do that
[24/11/2022, 19:04:37] Matthew Lees-Smith: okay
[24/11/2022, 19:04:44] Amy: 👍
[24/11/2022, 19:05:59] matt: does everyone actually check their emails tho
[24/11/2022, 19:06:12] Amy: We will if we know this is coming 😂
[24/11/2022, 19:06:32] Amy: It’s better than you know who everyone has Matt 😂 then you can be fully involved too
[24/11/2022, 19:06:32] Matthew Lees-Smith: I know there are ones where you go on select you name and put in your email then it instantly sends you a random name

[24/11/2022, 19:07:49] Amy: I think it’s just good if no one person knows you know
[24/11/2022, 19:07:56] Matthew Lees-Smith: also we can make it so if we don’t want certain people getting eachother (if they are partners)
[24/11/2022, 19:08:01] Matthew Lees-Smith: theen they dont
[24/11/2022, 19:08:06] Matthew Lees-Smith: yeah

[24/11/2022, 19:10:49] Amy: Just saying
[24/11/2022, 19:38:07] Natalie Nowell: It’s all on the page of the website, so when you’re on you can see who you have and everyone’s wish lists and stuff
[24/11/2022, 19:38:46] Natalie Nowell: And yes the organiser can specify if there’s anyone that shouldn’t be given someone else
[24/11/2022, 22:18:01] Jeni COGS: Quick question- with Secret Santa, do you get presents for each other a friends as well or is the point of it that everyone gets and gives a present and that is final so there's no awkwardness
[24/11/2022, 22:18:03] Jeni COGS: ??
[24/11/2022, 22:18:51] Natalie Nowell: Yh I think that’s usually the idea :)
[24/11/2022, 22:19:04] Natalie Nowell: As in that everyone ends up with a present each
[24/11/2022, 22:31:38] Jeni COGS: Yh

[27/11/2022, 18:33:21] Amy: And also in a second I’ll probably add him to the chat - or should I make a new one with the people going/in the secret Santa so we don’t add someone to a chat called who’s daddy…..?
[27/11/2022, 18:36:04] Holly Fowler: Hahaha 😂
[27/11/2022, 18:36:14] Holly Fowler: Good call about a different chat
[27/11/2022, 18:36:41] Amy: Okay I’ll probably do that if he replies yes to the secret Santa if not I’ll just keep the separate chat 😂😂

[27/11/2022, 19:24:53] Holly Fowler: Why? If Robert = Matt then that means “not Matt” = Matt, therefore a Holly can be a Matt

[27/11/2022, 19:25:42] matt: the maths is wrong
[27/11/2022, 19:25:42] Holly Fowler: Or should I say the Matts add up
[27/11/2022, 19:26:16] matt: i think you didn’t express the equation correctly
[27/11/2022, 19:26:21] matt: you forgot a few variables
[27/11/2022, 19:26:53] Holly Fowler: OHH sorry I forgot…
[27/11/2022, 19:27:53] Holly Fowler: What variable did I miss?
[27/11/2022, 19:28:09] matt: many variables
[27/11/2022, 19:28:25] Natalie Nowell: Well now you’re just singing with yourself that’s a bit sad
[27/11/2022, 19:28:30] matt: e.g. height
[27/11/2022, 19:28:47] matt: you just can’t take my outstanding voice
[27/11/2022, 19:28:47] Holly Fowler: What are the requirements?
[27/11/2022, 19:28:55] Holly Fowler: I’m 6’2”
[27/11/2022, 19:28:57] matt: the height requirements?
[27/11/2022, 19:29:01] matt: nah too short
[27/11/2022, 19:29:10] Natalie Nowell: Sure
[27/11/2022, 19:29:41] matt: well you didn’t continue it… so you must have been speechless from it
[27/11/2022, 19:31:09] matt: another variable is decisiveness
[27/11/2022, 19:31:21] Holly Fowler: I’m very decisive
[27/11/2022, 19:31:28] Holly Fowler: Will that be an issue?
[27/11/2022, 19:31:39] matt: idm
[27/11/2022, 19:31:50] matt: it could be an issue
[27/11/2022, 19:31:56] matt: but it might not be an issue
[27/11/2022, 19:32:08] matt: i’ll have to check with the other matts
[27/11/2022, 19:32:23] Holly Fowler: Okay, get back to me
[27/11/2022, 19:33:24] matt: um i’m not sure if it is an issue
[27/11/2022, 19:33:32] matt: also
[27/11/2022, 19:33:37] matt: music taste is a factor
[27/11/2022, 19:33:47] Holly Fowler: What are the requirements
[27/11/2022, 19:33:57] matt: nope
[27/11/2022, 19:34:04] matt: that is something you cannot change
[27/11/2022, 19:34:11] matt: it is inbuilt to matts
[27/11/2022, 19:34:45] Holly Fowler: But you do not know my music taste
[27/11/2022, 19:34:51] matt: okay
[27/11/2022, 19:35:02] matt: i will need to examine your playlist then
[27/11/2022, 19:36:03] matt: also on another note
[27/11/2022, 19:36:28] matt: life’s like a road that you travel on
[27/11/2022, 19:38:39] Holly Fowler: No it’s like a box of chocolates
[27/11/2022, 19:39:11] Holly Fowler: I don’t have a current playlist, just a list of liked songs
[27/11/2022, 19:39:34] matt: 😐
[27/11/2022, 19:40:05] matt: on a different note
[27/11/2022, 19:40:18] matt: does anyone know anywhere to get a good costume?
[27/11/2022, 19:40:22] Amy: Why….
[27/11/2022, 19:40:34] Amy: The party shop in byfleet
[27/11/2022, 19:41:31] matt: wait
[27/11/2022, 19:41:40] matt: there’s a party shop in byfleet?
[27/11/2022, 19:41:43] Amy: Yeh
[27/11/2022, 19:41:57] matt: i was trying to think of presents
[27/11/2022, 19:42:01] Amy: Tbf not sure how many costumes they have just saw a few
[27/11/2022, 19:42:05] Amy: Fair enough 😂
[27/11/2022, 19:43:03] matt: or know anywhere to get a custom shirt of sorts?
[27/11/2022, 19:43:15] Amy: Online?
[27/11/2022, 19:43:22] matt: cos idk how reliable the online ones are
[27/11/2022, 19:43:29] matt: i want it embroided
[27/11/2022, 19:43:39] matt: so it is a very niche present
[27/11/2022, 19:43:48] matt: and i want it to say something very specific
[27/11/2022, 19:44:09] Amy: Right… be careful in case your person gets switched if we have to re do it 😂
[27/11/2022, 19:44:11] Holly Fowler: Matt I’ll give you the first 5 artists I see on my liked songs. Fleetwood Mac, Jamiroquai, Billy Joel, Bee Gees, ABBA
[27/11/2022, 19:45:14] matt: ah i’m sure it will be fine
[27/11/2022, 19:45:25] matt: i can work around that
[27/11/2022, 19:45:35] matt: abba is a bit no no
[27/11/2022, 19:45:51] matt: @447961063913 /matt can agree with that…
[27/11/2022, 19:46:12] matt: *big

[27/11/2022, 19:47:59] matt: we would show you the equation for a matt
[27/11/2022, 19:48:03] matt: but it is secret
[27/11/2022, 19:48:07] Holly Fowler: That’s the first time I’ve been able to read one of Rob’s infamous deleted messages
[27/11/2022, 19:48:23] matt: who’s rob?
[27/11/2022, 19:48:25] Natalie Nowell: Yh I was gonna say Matt, is this not going to be really obvious now who you have when the person opens your present 😂
[27/11/2022, 19:48:34] Robert Wood: yes, sorry i thought id done that thing again where i replied to a really old message as just opened this on my browser

[27/11/2022, 19:49:55] Natalie Nowell: Ok fine you seem to know what you’re doing 😂

[27/11/2022, 19:50:15] matt: it is part of my master plan

[27/11/2022, 19:51:20] matt: NO NO
[27/11/2022, 19:51:30] matt: they might try and find the equation out
[27/11/2022, 19:51:32] matt: and leak it
[27/11/2022, 19:51:40] Robert Wood: Not written down, just verbally agreed

‎OPTION: Yes (0 votes)
‎OPTION: Absolutely (0 votes)
‎OPTION: Is that even a question? (2 votes)
[27/11/2022, 19:53:26] Natalie Nowell: STOP SAYING THE ELEMENTS OF YOUR PRESENT MATT 😂
[27/11/2022, 19:53:50] Holly Fowler: Just for an initial opinion poll, before the Matt council votes on their decision
[27/11/2022, 19:53:54] matt: oh
[27/11/2022, 19:54:01] matt: i might have to change my present now

[27/11/2022, 19:55:01] matt: maybe a new lego set i saw it is
[27/11/2022, 19:55:01] Robert Wood: no non member polls will be taken into consideration
[27/11/2022, 19:55:22] matt: the poll was not approved by the council
[27/11/2022, 19:56:13] Holly Fowler: Any candidate has a right to gather information on their odds of being elected
[27/11/2022, 19:57:08] Robert Wood: you have the right yes, however our process of membership only comes to a vote of the matt^3 council post meeting a non-disclosed criteria
[27/11/2022, 19:57:48] Robert Wood: 😂 just why did i write that
[27/11/2022, 19:58:09] Amy: No idea just like I don’t have a clue what’s doing on
[27/11/2022, 19:58:18] matt: I AM THE SENATE
[27/11/2022, 19:58:34] Holly Fowler: Legal jargon is addictive
[27/11/2022, 19:58:53] matt: i think we are gonna have to consult our lawyers now
[27/11/2022, 19:59:09] Robert Wood: i know a chap at surrey uni doing law
[27/11/2022, 19:59:23] Robert Wood: actually i know 2
[27/11/2022, 19:59:24] matt: and i have another friend doing law 👀
[27/11/2022, 20:00:09] Holly Fowler: I pray that God grants the Matt^3 council the wisdom to make the right decision, the decision that takes the future of this chat out of the darkness and into the light.
[27/11/2022, 20:00:16] matt: where’s the best place to find tickets for a musical if anyone knows btw?

[28/11/2022, 21:59:47] Robert Wood: still got over a month so no harm to give him a bit of time
[28/11/2022, 22:00:41] Amy: Yeh I agree,  not gonna chase him a day after I sent the message 😂 he may just be checking if he can actually make it isk
[28/11/2022, 22:06:27] matt: ah trueeeee
[28/11/2022, 22:15:42] Holly Fowler: I agree, I was asking though because I want to make sure my ideas are on the right track for secret Santa!
[28/11/2022, 22:23:28] matt: OH ACTUALLY… it would be good to check something - does anyone have an allergies?
[28/11/2022, 22:23:48] Jeni COGS: Freya- cashew nuts and some other nuts
[28/11/2022, 22:24:08] Jeni COGS: But especially cashew pretty sure ;)
[28/11/2022, 22:24:13] matt: it is just sooooo everyone else just has a heads up :)
[28/11/2022, 22:24:20] Jeni COGS: From the times she has nearly died
[28/11/2022, 22:24:32] Jeni COGS: Smart
[28/11/2022, 22:24:56] matt: just so whoever has someone who does just make sure they DON’T get something with that in
[28/11/2022, 22:25:20] Jeni COGS: That was nicely ambiguous
[28/11/2022, 22:27:33] matt: ambiguous is my middle name
[28/11/2022, 22:30:07] Natalie Nowell: Yh let’s not kill Freya
[28/11/2022, 22:30:26] Jeni COGS: She is pretty important
[28/11/2022, 22:30:54] Natalie Nowell: Was more thinking we don’t want any blood on our hands, but sure 😌
[28/11/2022, 22:31:08] Jeni COGS: Out damned spot
[28/11/2022, 22:33:13] freya: yh pls don’t
[28/11/2022, 22:33:20] freya: awww
[28/11/2022, 22:33:45] Robert Wood: I mean....
[28/11/2022, 22:33:54] freya: how dare
[28/11/2022, 22:34:05] Holly Fowler: Genuine question, does anaphylactic shock expel any blood? Like at all?
[28/11/2022, 22:34:22] Jeni COGS: True true....probably not
[28/11/2022, 22:34:40] Holly Fowler: So it would be an untraceable crime…
[28/11/2022, 22:34:44] Ben (Amy): No it just stops you breathing untill you die 🙃
[28/11/2022, 22:34:54] Ben (Amy): Not really…
[28/11/2022, 22:34:54] Jeni COGS: It would come up in the post mortem
[28/11/2022, 22:35:12] Ben (Amy): Indeed
[28/11/2022, 22:35:30] Holly Fowler: Never mind then, back to the drawing board
[28/11/2022, 22:36:28] matt: wait a minute
[28/11/2022, 22:36:38] matt: what were you guys thinking 🤨
[28/11/2022, 22:36:41] Jeni COGS: The best way the kill someone is potassium overdose and you can leave the body to be found or just kill them however and feed them to some pigs
[28/11/2022, 22:37:02] Holly Fowler: Wuh oh
[28/11/2022, 22:37:47] Holly Fowler: I feel like this isn’t the first time we’ve talked about how to kill someone, is it Jen? 😂
[28/11/2022, 22:38:09] Jeni COGS: Your memory serves you correctly
[28/11/2022, 22:38:23] Jeni COGS: It's an excellent talking point
[28/11/2022, 22:38:27] Robert Wood: I am concerned
[28/11/2022, 22:38:29] Natalie Nowell: Car antifreeze is my go to, it tastes sweet apparently so easy to conceal in a sweet drink for the intended victim
[28/11/2022, 22:38:34] Natalie Nowell: But I agree about the pigs
[28/11/2022, 22:38:46] Jeni COGS: Your go to!
[28/11/2022, 22:38:52] Natalie Nowell: 😏
[28/11/2022, 22:39:12] Jeni COGS: Ah we learned from the best....
[28/11/2022, 22:39:14] Jeni COGS: Your fathee
[28/11/2022, 22:39:24] Natalie Nowell: Indeed 😂
[28/11/2022, 22:39:45] Holly Fowler: Oh my
[28/11/2022, 22:42:34] Holly Fowler: Well I think it’s fair to say that if the secret service WERE monitoring messages, the very last thing they’d think this was is a group chat for a bunch of christians
[28/11/2022, 22:44:32] Jeni COGS: Yup. You know when people ask you about faith and say stuff like 'oh you must not drink or swear or be rude to your parents, you must be a saint' and all you can think about is the chat on your phone that is called 'Who's Daddy'
[28/11/2022, 22:55:10] matt: i hope that this has not been thought about being applied
[28/11/2022, 22:55:28] matt: ah there is going to be a new group chat name on thursday
[29/11/2022, 06:57:04] Holly Fowler: I didn’t know these chat names were planned ahead 😅
